      <h1>Body Systems LSM400 Linear Smith Machine</h1>
      <p>
        Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and the LSM400
        leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners,
        the LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety and control
        associated with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective
        use of gravity for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout
        partner. Lock points can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside
        of your body's natural range of motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can tailor the LSM400 to meet your specific workout needs. Start
        with the basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs
        grow, add a lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer.
        Accessories are easy to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your
        workout without delay. The LSM400 works with all standard Olympic weight
        plates.
      </p>

      <p>
        The LSM400 is compact with all components placed on one side of the unit
        for easy access. This makes the LSM400 perfect for people who want a
        quality home gym, but do not have a lot of space. Place the LSM400
        against a wall and you're ready to go!

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul class="features">
        <li>
          <strong>Smooth Smith Action:</strong> The bar (rated at 800 lb.
          capacity) slides on Teflon bushings alongside solid steel guide rods.
          Smooth motion is key to successful workouts, as the target muscles are
          utilized to their full potential with each repetition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proper Angle:</strong> The bar travels along a 7 degree path
          from vertical. Studies have shown that this is the proper lifting
          angle to increase your comfort and prevent injury.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safety:</strong> The LSM400 has 20 lock-out points for a safe,
          solid stop at any point in your workout routine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rugged:</strong> Constructed with heavy 12 gauge steel and 7
          gauge reinforcing plate. This is a unit built to last.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Warranty:</strong> Every part of the LSM400 has a lifetime
